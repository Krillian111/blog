# About me

- Fullstack developer from Germany with a preference for backend and DevOps.
- Got into programming during my undergrad while doing an internship. Continued to work during my graduate degree in mathematics. Never looked back.
- I like getting to the bottom of things. I don't get frustrated easily when things get more complicated. Reading specifications or documentation is the main way I learn things, not a big fan of just superficially learning from videos or StackOverflow. They are more an inspiration what to look into, not the end of the story.

## Trivia

- Enjoy hiking with my wife, cycling, good food and beer.
- I cycled from Victoria to Toronto while camping in a tent.
