# About me

- Fullstack developer from Germany with a preference for Backend and DevOps. Moved to the US in 2021.
- Got into programming during an undergrad internship in 2014. Continued to develop web applications during my graduate degree in mathematics. Never looked back.
- I like getting to the bottom of things. I don't get frustrated easily when things get more complicated. Reading specifications or documentation is the main way I learn things, not a big fan of just superficially learning from videos or StackOverflow. They are more an inspiration what to look into, not the end of the story.
- I am interested in anything related to the web platform, i.e. web applications, infrastructure, network, system design, WASM, ...

## Trivia

- Most people call me Bow (like bow and arrow), Krillian is only an old gamer tag which and a bit more unique for purposes like accounts and domains.
- I enjoy hiking with my wife, cycling, good food and beer.
- I cycled over 6000km from Victoria, BC to Toronto while camping in a tent.
