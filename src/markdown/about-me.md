# About me

- Backend developer from Germany who also enjoys setting up infrastructure and DevOps. I am happy to realize a UI Designer's vision if necessary but it's not my strength.
- Moved to the US in 2021 / 2022.
- Got into programming during an undergrad internship in 2014. Continued to develop web applications during my graduate degree in mathematics. Never looked back.
- I like getting to the bottom of things. I don't get frustrated easily when things get more complicated. Reading specifications or documentation is the main way I learn things, not a big fan of just superficially learning from videos or StackOverflow. They are more an inspiration to find good sources and clarify ambiguity of terminology.
- I am interested in anything related to the web platform, i.e. web applications, infrastructure, network, system design, WASM, ...

## Trivia

- Most people call me Beau or Bow (like bow and arrow), Krillian is only an old gamer tag but it is a bit more unique for purposes like accounts and domains.
- I enjoy hiking with my wife, cycling and cooking.
- I cycled over 6000km from Victoria, BC to Toronto while camping in a tent.
