# About me

## The basics

- Backend developer from Germany who also enjoys working on infrastructure and DevOps.
- Moved to the US in 2021 / 2022 and got my green card.
- Got seriously into programming during an undergrad internship in 2014. Continued every since and never looked back.

## At work

- Got my Masters in Mathematics but have a Minor in Computer Science and I think it really helped me become thorough and not develop an aversion for very formal things like IAM, security or cryptography.
- I like getting to the bottom of things. I like reading specs when trying to understand something as they are the foundation of the internet in my opinion.
- I am interested in anything related to the web platform, i.e. web applications, infrastructure, network, system design, WASM, ...

## Trivia

- Most people call me Beau or Bow (like bow and arrow)
- I enjoy hiking with my wife, cycling and cooking.
- I cycled over 6000km from Victoria, BC to Toronto while camping in a tent.
- Krillian is only an old gamer tag but it is a bit more unique for purposes like accounts and domains.
