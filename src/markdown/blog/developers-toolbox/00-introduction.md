# Developers Toolbox Series

## Introduction

When I started out as a software developer I had a hard time to figure out what to learn first. I had only so much time and wanted to spend it wisely. There are so many topics where you feel a bit lost in the beginning:

- What is acceptable or clean code?
- What are patterns or techniques that I should know?
- How do I get better?
- How do I review a pull request?
- What technologies should I learn?
- How to write tests?

There are even more questions when you take into account the particular direction you want to go in, e.g. full-stack in my case. While trying to find answers to these questions, I read a lot and grew by doing that. However, it is easy to get lost in the details and reading a book is big investment if all you want is to get a rough idea to get started.

Now that I have new colleagues asking me the same questions I had back then, I realized that sometimes it's hard to give a concise answer. I have developed an intuition but explaining that and the reasoning behind it to another person is hard.

Therefore I wanted to start a series where I discuss some of the things I learned in the first years on the job. The goal is that you can read each post by itself and that it is suitable to beginners. I might get into more complicated topics later, time will tell.

Obviously this is going to be opinionated. If you don't care about a particular topic, just skip it. I will focus on things that I consider relevant or helpful for someone who is trying to become a full-stack developer but most of it, especially in the beginning, will be general ideas regarding programming.

Last but not least: Be critical when you read my stuff. I cannot stress enough how imported it is, that you question what other people tell you about programming. The most frustrating people to work with are those, who insist on doing things a certain way, while having "duh, it's a best practice" as their only explanation.

Develop your own opinion and learn to express why you hold that opinion. A lot of best practices are simply conventions to deal with the limitations of that time. If you don't know why you are doing something, it is easy to miss that it is outdated by now.
