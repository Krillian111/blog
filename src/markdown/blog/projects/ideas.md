# Projects ideas

- JIRA markup to Markdown converter CLI to avoid having to remember the JIRA syntax
  - could be a nice exercise to write the parser by hand, create an AST, perform the transformation at node level, serialize the mapped AST.
- TODO list app to try out kubernetes/minikube and potentially self host my TODOs
- play around with the worker pool in node and webworkers in the browser, e.g. for logging?

## Software to check out when building my stuff

- [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) as Postman alternative?
- [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) for authentication?
