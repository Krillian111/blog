# Learning about programming

## Beginner

- [Clean Code](https://books.google.com/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=hjEFCAAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)
  - Important basics about programming and TDD
- [Clean Coder](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Clean_Coder.html?id=VQlvAQAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)
  - Important basics on how to behave as a software engineer on the job

## General

- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#client-server-background)
  - Unix network programming basics
  - I don't know any C but I could still take away a lot by just reading it. It gives you a basic understanding what higher level languages do in order to come up with the convenience APIs they provide you with.
