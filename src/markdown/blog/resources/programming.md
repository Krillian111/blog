# Learning about programming

## Beginner

- [Clean Code](https://books.google.com/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=hjEFCAAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)
  - Important basics about programming and TDD
- [Clean Coder](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Clean_Coder.html?id=VQlvAQAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)
  - Important basics on how to behave as a software engineer on the job

## Network

- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#client-server-background)
  - Unix network programming basics
  - I don't know any C but I could still take away a lot by just reading it. It gives you a basic understanding what higher level languages do in order to come up with the convenience APIs they provide you with. You don't have to read all of it. Later in the guide it goes into quite some details w.r.t the APIs which I personally skipped.
- [TCP source & destination port number](https://www.firewall.cx/networking-topics/protocols/tcp/133-tcp-source-destination-ports.html)
  - Short article explaining how TCP connection are routed on an OS/process level.
  - I found this article when reading [this very enlightning StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152457/what-is-the-difference-between-a-port-and-a-socket/152863#152863) trying to go in-depth answering the question "What is the difference between a port and a socket?"

## Databases

- [7 Database Paradigms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw&feature=youtu.be)
  - Short overview over database paradigms and their use cases

## Containers

- [Cracking the Docker CLI](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-101-container-mgmt-commands/)
  - Overview of docker CLI and how the different commands relate to each other.
  - For this article it is good to have run into some of the pitfalls of docker before. This way you can go back mentally and understand why certain things happened the way they did.

## Language articles

- [Issues with Golang](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang)
  - Interesting read about what people think about when weighing pros and cons of a language
