# Project ideas

- play around with the worker pool in node and webworkers in the browser, e.g. for logging?
- JIRA markup to Markdown converter CLI to avoid having to remember the JIRA syntax
  - could be a nice exercise to write the parser by hand, create an AST, perform the transformation at node level, serialize the mapped AST.
- TODO list app to try out `kubernetes`/`minikube` and potentially self host my TODOs
